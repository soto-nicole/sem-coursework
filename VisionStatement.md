# Vision Statement

## Intro
### Purpose
The intended purpose for this application is to provide the organization Fresh Blooms with the ability to view and report on population information from around the world. The task is to design and implement a new system to allow easy access to this population information.  
This will enable them to pinpoint the most populated countries, cities and other areas in the world to find new places to distribute their products to. There is also an intention to provide number of speakers of specific languages - this will help the company prioritise translation efforts for their global marketing to reach more customers. 
The main teams this system will benefit are marketing and logistics.
n existing SQL database exists with this population data which can be utilized by the application.

### Solution Overview
The application will provide a tabular front-end view to the database, offering users the ability to view and filter pre-defined population records from different areas of the world. These will be ordered from largest to smallest population, to visualize immediately where the largest impacts may be had.
This will allow the team to quickly receive specific data of the populations being sought after and contribute to important business decisions based on the resulting data. This includes number of people living in specific cities, countries, continents and even the number of people who speak certain languages across the world.

## User Description
Individuals using the application within these teams are likely individuals with limited technical knowledge â€“ instead focused on the business knowledge that can be gleaned from the application. They require a simple and quick way to access their desired data to complement business needs. This could potentially take the form of an interactive website or a desktop application - which is clearly labeled and easy to navigate.
